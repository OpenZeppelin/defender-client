# Defender Relay Client

Defender Relay lets you spin up private relayers to send transactions to any public Ethereum network. Each relayer has its own secure private key, and a set of API keys. You can send transactions via your relayers by POSTing to the Defender HTTP API, or using this library.

This library also includes an [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) signer and a [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) provider, that uses the Relay to sign and broadcast its transactions.

## Install

```bash
npm install defender-relay-client
```

```bash
yarn add defender-relay-client
```

## Usage

Start by creating a new relayer in Defender for a network of your choice, and write down the API key and secret. Then use them to create a new `Relayer` instance in your code:

```js
import { Relayer } from 'defender-relay-client';
const relayer = new Relayer({apiKey: API_KEY, apiSecret: API_SECRET});
```

And use the relayer instance to send a transaction:

```js
const tx = await relayer.sendTransaction({
  to: '0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f',
  value: '0x16345785d8a0000',
  data: '0x5af3107a',
  speed: 'fast',
  gasLimit: 100000
});
```

The `sendTransaction` call returns once the transaction has been _signed_ by the relayer. To monitor the transaction status, see [Querying](#Querying) below.

### Speed

Instead of accepting a fixed `gasPrice`, the relayer accepts a `speed` parameter that can be one of `safeLow`, `average`, `fast`, or `fastest`. The relayer will determine the gas price based on these values from [ethgasstation](https://ethgasstation.info/), and update it regularly by resubmitting your transaction if it fails to get mined.

### Return data

The returned transaction object `tx` will have the following shape:

```ts
transactionId: string; // Defender transaction identifier
hash: string; // Ethereum transaction hash
to: string;
from: string;
value: string;
data: string;
gasPrice: number;
gasLimit: number;
nonce: number;
chainId: number;
status: 'pending' | 'sent' | 'submitted' | 'inmempool' | 'mined' | 'confirmed';
speed: 'safeLow' | 'average' | 'fast' | 'fastest';
```

## Querying transactions

The `relayer` object also has a `query` function that returns a transaction object as described above. This method receives the `transactionId`, **not** the transaction `hash`:

```js
const latestTx = await relayer.query(tx.transactionId);
```

Alternatively, the `relayer` can also be used to `list` the latest transactions sent, optionally filtering by status and creation time.

```js
const since = await relayer.list({
  since: new Date(Date.now() - 60 * 1000),
  status: 'pending', // can be 'pending', 'mined', or 'failed'
  limit: 5,
})
```

Defender will update the transaction `status` every minute, marking it as `confirmed` after 12 confirmations. The transaction information will be stored for 30 days.

### Why querying?

The `query` function is important to monitor the transaction status, since Defender may choose to _resubmit the transaction with a different gas price_, effectively changing its hash. This means that, if you monitor your transaction only via `getTransactionReceipt(tx.hash)` calls to a node, you may not get the latest info if it was replaced.

Defender may replace a transaction by increasing its gas price if it has not been mined for a period of time, and the gas price costs have increased since the transaction was originally submitted. Also, in a case where a transaction consistently fails to be mined, Defender may replace it by a _no-op_ (a transaction with no value or data) in order to advance the sender account nonce.

### Replacing transactions

You can use the relayer methods `replaceTransactionById` or `replaceTransactionByNonce` to replace a transaction given its nonce or transactionId (not hash) if it has not been mined yet. You can use this to increase the speed of a transaction, or replace your tx by an empty value transfer (with a gas limit of 21000) to cancel a transaction that is no longer valid.

```js
// Cancel a transaction with nonce 42 by sending a zero-value transfer to replace it
const tx = await relayer.replaceTransactionByNonce(42, {
  to: '0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f',
  value: '0x00',
  data: '0x',
  speed: 'fastest',
  gasLimit: 21000
});
```

You can also replace by nonce using the `ethers.js` and `web3.js` adapters listed below.

## Signing

You can sign any hex string (`0x123213`) using a `sign` method of the relayer. Pay attention, that the message has to be a **hex string**.

```js
  const signResponse = await relayer.sign({ message: msg });
```

### Return data

Once your data is signed, the following response will be returned:

```js
export interface SignedMessagePayload {
    sig: Hex;
    r: Hex;
    s: Hex;
    v: number;
}
```

## Network calls

You can also use Defender for making arbitrary JSON RPC calls to the network via the `call` method. All JSON RPC methods are supported, except for event filters and websocket subscriptions.

```js
const balance = await relayer.call('eth_getBalance', ['0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f', 'latest']);
```

## Ethers.js

You can use the `defender-relay-client` with [ethers.js v5](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) directly. The package exports a `DefenderRelaySigner` [signer](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/) that is used to send transactions, and a `DefenderRelayProvider` [provider](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/) that is used to make calls to the network through Defender.

Make sure to have `ethers` installed in your project, and initialize a new defender signer instance like:

```js
const { DefenderRelayProvider, DefenderRelaySigner } = require('defender-relay-client/lib/ethers');
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

const credentials = { apiKey: API_KEY, apiSecret: API_SECRET };
const provider = new DefenderRelayProvider(credentials);
const signer = new DefenderRelaySigner(credentials, provider, { speed: 'fast' });
```

You can then use it to send any transactions, such as executing a contract function. The `tx` object returned will be a regular ethers.js `TransactionResponse` object, with the addition of Defender's `transactionId` field.

```js
const erc20 = new ethers.Contract(ERC20_ADDRESS, ERC20_ABI, signer);
const tx = await erc20.functions.transfer(beneficiary, 1e18.toString());
const mined = await tx.wait();
```

The `signMessage` method is supported as well, allowing to sign an arbitrary data with a relayer key.

```js
const signed = await signer.signMessage('Funds are safu!');
```

### Limitations

The current implementation of the `DefenderRelaySigner` for ethers.js has the following limitations:
- Due to validations set up in `ethers.js`, it is not possible to specify the transaction `speed` for an individual transaction when sending it. It must be set during the signer construction, and will be used for all transactions sent through it.
- A `wait` on the transaction to be mined will only wait for the current transaction hash (see [Querying](#Querying)). If Defender Relayer replaces the transaction with a different one, this operation will time out. This is ok for fast transactions, since Defender only reprices after a few minutes. But if you expect the transaction to take a long time to be mined, then ethers' `wait` may not work. Future versions will also include an ethers provider aware of this.

## Web3.js 

You can also use the `defender-relay-client` with [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) via a `DefenderRelayProvider` which routes all JSON RPC calls through Defender, and uses a Relayer for signing and broadcasting transactions.

```js
const { DefenderRelayProvider } = require('defender-relay-client/lib/web3');
const Web3 = require('web3');

const credentials = { apiKey: API_KEY, apiSecret: API_SECRET };
const provider = new DefenderRelayProvider(credentials, { speed: 'fast' });
const web3 = new Web3(provider);
```

You can then use the `web3` instance to query and send transactions as you would normally do:

```js
const [from] = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
const erc20 = new web3.eth.Contract(ERC20_ABI, ERC20_ADDRESS, { from });
const tx = await erc20.methods.transfer(beneficiary, (1e18).toString()).send();
```

You can also sign messages using the Relayer key via the `sign` method:

```js
const signature = await web3.eth.sign('0xdead', from);
```

The package also includes two composable lower-level providers, the `DefenderRelaySenderProvider` and `DefenderRelayQueryProvider`. The former intercepts all `sendTransaction` methods and serves them via the Relayer, while the latter uses Defender's JSON RPC interface for all method calls. The `DefenderRelayProvider` shown above combines the two.

Note that these web3.js providers currently have the same limitations as the ethers.js one described above.

## Using in Autotasks

[Defender Autotasks](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/autotasks) natively support integration with Defender Relay, allowing to send transactions without providing API keys. In your autotask's code, just `require('defender-relay-client')` and construct a new relayer instance using the `credentials` object injected by the autotask. This will give you a relayer object already configured.

```js
const { Relayer } = require('defender-relay-client');

exports.handler =  async function(event) {
  const relayer = new Relayer(event);

  const txRes = await relayer.sendTransaction({
    to: '0xc7dd3ff5b387db0130854fe5f141a78586f417c6',
    value: 100,
    speed: 'fast',
    gasLimit: '1000000',
  });

  console.log(txRes);
  return txRes.hash;
}
```
