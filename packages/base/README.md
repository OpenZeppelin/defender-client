# Defender Base Client

OpenZeppelin Defender provides a security operations (SecOps) platform for Ethereum with built-in best practices. Development teams implement Defender to ship faster and minimize security risks.

Certain components of Defender, such as Admin or Relay, can be interacted with programmatically via an API. This library provides the base class for the clients.

# End Of Support Notice

We will no longer be maintaining or supporting any additional releases for defender-client. Please migrate to defender-sdk as soon as possible to get all the benefits of defender 2.0 and more.
