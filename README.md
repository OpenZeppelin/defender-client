# Defender Clients

Monorepo that contains Defender typescript clients. Check out the individual packages for more info:

- [defender-admin-client](packages/admin)
- [defender-autotask-client](packages/autotask-client)
- [defender-autotask-utils](packages/autotask-utils)
- [defender-kvstore-client](packages/kvstore)
- [defender-relay-client](packages/relay)
- [defender-sentinel-client](packages/sentinel)

## Development Setup

Checkout the repo and run `yarn && yarn build`.

## Testing

Run `yarn test` to run unit tests across all packages.

## Linting

Run `yarn lint` at the project root.

## Publish

Use `lerna` for publishing a new version of all packages. 

The following publishes a release candidate with the npm tag `next`:

```
yarn run lerna publish v1.3.0-rc.4 --preid rc --dist-tag next --pre-dist-tag next --exact
```

And to publish the final release:

```
yarn run lerna publish --exact
```

## Examples

The `examples` repo has sample code for both clients. Note that most examples rely on dotenv for loading API keys and secrets. Note that you can set the following environment variables to control to which instance your client will connect to, which is useful for testing against your Defender development instance:

```
# Example config 
# relay signer
DEFENDER_RELAY_SIGNER_API_URL=
DEFENDER_RELAY_SIGNER_POOL_ID=
DEFENDER_RELAY_SIGNER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=
# relay client
DEFENDER_RELAY_API_URL=
DEFENDER_RELAY_POOL_ID=
DEFENDER_RELAY_POOL_CLIENT_ID=
# admin client
DEFENDER_ADMIN_API_URL=
DEFENDER_ADMIN_POOL_ID=
DEFENDER_ADMIN_POOL_CLIENT_ID=
# autotask client
DEFENDER_AUTOTASK_API_URL=
DEFENDER_AUTOTASK_POOL_ID=
DEFENDER_AUTOTASK_POOL_CLIENT_ID=
# sentinel client
DEFENDER_SENTINEL_API_URL=
DEFENDER_SENTINEL_POOL_ID=
DEFENDER_SENTINEL_POOL_CLIENT_ID=
```
